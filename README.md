# jquery.selectall
jquery plugin to help implement a select all checkbox

Select all checkbox should have attribute `[data-js=selectAll]` and checkboxes should have `[name=selected]`

NOTE: this plugin is set up to be used as an ES6 module through browserify/webpack. You'll have to fork/modify the file if you want to load directly into the browser.
